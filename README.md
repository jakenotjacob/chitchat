========
A console IRC client written in Ruby and Ncurses!

Usage
=====
Unfortunately, as it is a program under the knife, the features are
VERY limited at the moment... though of course it means I'm working
to add more!

Joining a Network
-----------------
`/connect IRC.SOMENETWORK.NET`
This will cause the server window to appear.
Once it is there, you can now join channels!

Joining a Channel
-----------------
`/join CHANNELNAME`
NOTE: _DO NOT_ precede the channel name with a crunch(#) !

Switching Channel Panes
-----------------------
Just hit your `TAB` key to cycle through channel windows! This
includes the server window in the rotation as well.

To be fed soon...
